# Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA

A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question.

## Learning More about Enterprise QnA 

Enterprise QnA is built on a pattern the AI community calls "Retrieval-Augmented Generation" (RAG). In addition to this repository having a reference architecture on how to implement this pattern on Azure, here are resources to familiarize yourself with the concepts in RAG, and samples to learn each underlying product's APIs:

# IMPORTANT NOTE (OpenAI generated)
We have made some changes to the data format in the latest update of this repo. 
<br>The new format is more efficient and compatible with the latest standards and libraries. However, we understand that some of you may have existing applications that rely on the previous format and may not be able to migrate to the new one immediately.

Therefore, we have provided a way for you to continue using the previous format in a running application. All you need to do is to set your web application tag to fruocco/oai-embeddings:2023-03-27_25. This will ensure that your application will use the data format that was available on March 27, 2023. We strongly recommend that you update your applications to use the new format as soon as possible.

If you want to move to the new format, please go to:
-   "Add Document" -> "Add documents in Batch" and click on "Convert all files and add embeddings" to reprocess your documents. 
          
# Use the Repo with Chat based deployment (gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4-32k or gpt-4)
By default, the repo uses an Instruction based model (like text-davinci-003) for QnA and Chat experience.  
If you want to use a Chat based deployment (gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4-32k or gpt-4), please change the environment variables as described [here](#environment-variables)

## Deploy on Azure (WebApp + Batch Processing) with Azure Cognitive Search
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fruoccofabrizio%2Fazure-open-ai-embeddings-qna%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2Fdeployment_ACS.json)

Click on the Deploy to Azure button and configure your settings in the Azure Portal as described in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

![Architecture](docs/architecture_acs.png)

Please be aware that you need:
-   an existing Azure OpenAI resource with models deployments (instruction models e.g. text-davinci-003, and embeddings models e.g. text-embedding-ada-002)

### Signing up for Vector Search Private Preview in Azure Cognitive Search
Azure Cognitive Search supports searching using pure vectors, pure text, or in hybrid mode where both are combined. For the vector-based cases, you'll need to sign up for Vector Search Private Preview. To sign up, please fill in this form: [https://aka.ms/VectorSearchSignUp](https://aka.ms/VectorSearchSignUp).

Preview functionality is provided under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement, and isn't recommended for production workloads.


## Deploy on Azure (WebApp + Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise + Batch Processing)
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fruoccofabrizio%2Fazure-open-ai-embeddings-qna%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2FdeploymentACRE.json)

Click on the Deploy to Azure button to automatically deploy a template on Azure by with the resources needed to run this example. This option will provision an instance of [Azure Cache for Redis](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview) with [RediSearch](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-redis-modules#redisearch) installed to store vectors and perform the similiarity search. 

![Architecture](docs/architecture_acre.png)

Please be aware that you still need:
-   an existing Azure OpenAI resource with models deployments (instruction models e.g. `text-davinci-003`, and embeddings models e.g. `text-embedding-ada-002`) 
-   an existing Form Recognizer Resource 
-   an existing Translator Resource
-   Azure marketplace access. (Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise uses the marketplace for IP billing)

You will add the endpoint and access key information for these resources when deploying the template. 

## Deploy on Azure (WebApp + Redis Stack + Batch Processing)
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fruoccofabrizio%2Fazure-open-ai-embeddings-qna%2Fmain%2Finfrastructure%2Fdeployment.json)

Click on the Deploy to Azure button and configure your settings in the Azure Portal as described in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

![Architecture](docs/architecture_redis.png)

Please be aware that you need:
-   an existing Azure OpenAI resource with models deployments (instruction models e.g. `text-davinci-003`, and embeddings models e.g. `text-embedding-ada-002`) 
-   an existing Form Recognizer Resource (OPTIONAL - if you want to extract text out of documents)
-   an existing Translator Resource (OPTIONAL - if you want to translate documents)

## Run everything locally in Docker (WebApp + Redis Stack + Batch Processing)

First, clone the repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna
cd azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna
```

Next, configure your `.env` as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables):


```console
cp .env.template .env
vi .env # or use whatever you feel comfortable with
```

Finally run the application:

```console
docker compose up
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This will spin up three Docker containers:
-   The WebApp itself
-   Redis Stack for storing the embeddings
-   Batch Processing Azure Function

NOTE: Please note that the Batch Processing Azure Function uses an Azure Storage Account for queuing the documents to process. Please create a Queue named "doc-processing" in the account used for the "AzureWebJobsStorage" env setting.

## Run everything locally in Python with Conda (WebApp only)

This requires Redis running somewhere and expects that you've setup `.env` as described above. In this case, point `REDIS_ADDRESS` to your Redis deployment. 

You can run a local Redis instance via:
```console
 docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

You can run a local Batch Processing Azure Function:
```console
 docker run -p 7071:80 fruocco/oai-batch:latest
```

Create `conda` environment for Python:

```console
conda env create -f code/environment.yml
conda activate openai-qna-env
```

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Run WebApp:
```console
cd code
streamlit run OpenAI_Queries.py
```

## Run everything locally in Python with venv
This requires Redis running somewhere and expects that you've setup `.env` as described above. In this case, point `REDIS_ADDRESS` to your Redis deployment. 

You can run a local Redis instance via:
```console
 docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

You can run a local Batch Processing Azure Function:
```console
 docker run -p 7071:80 fruocco/oai-batch:latest
```

Please ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

Create `venv` environment for Python:

```console
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install `PIP` Requirements
```console
pip install -r code\requirements.txt
```

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Run the WebApp
```console
cd code
streamlit run OpenAI_Queries.py
```

## Run WebApp locally in Docker against an existing Redis deployment

### Option 1 - Run the prebuilt Docker image

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Then run:

```console
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:80 fruocco/oai-embeddings:latest
```

### Option 2 - Build the Docker image yourself

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

```console
docker build . -f Dockerfile -t your_docker_registry/your_docker_image:your_tag
docker run --env-file .env -p 8080:80 your_docker_registry/your_docker_image:your_tag
```

Note: You can use 
-   WebApp.Dockerfile to build the Web Application
-   BatchProcess.Dockerfile to build the Azure Function for Batch Processing

## Use the QnA API from the backend
You can use a QnA API on your data exposed by the Azure Function for Batch Processing. 

```python
